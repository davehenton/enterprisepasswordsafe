### What is it?

The Enterprise Password Safe was sold by several companies from the mid-2000's through to 2014 and was used by customers from small businesses to multi-nationals and parts of government agencies around the globe. It is a multi-user, audited password storage solution with user and group access controls.

### How does it work?

The Enterprise Password Safe (EPS) uses a cryptographic chain to enforce password access; A key is derived from the users password which decrypts a user specific AES key. The user key is then used to decrypt the AES keys for the groups the user belongs to, and then the users AES key and the AES keys of the groups they belong to, can be used to decrypt the RSA public key (for read access), and RSA private key (for write access) associated with a password.

The key pair for each password is different, and the keys are encrypted with each group or user AES key that have access rules for that password.

### More details

The EPS is written in Java and built using [Gradle](https://gradle.org). It uses JDBC to talk to the database which is used to store the information via a custom database abstraction layer which handles the translation of EPS requests into a database specific format. The EPS includes support for Apache Derby, DB2, HSQLDB, JavaDB, MySQL, Oracle 8i, Postgresql, and SQL Server.
